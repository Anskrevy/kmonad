* Quick notes
- Because of how stack handles internal libraries, you will have to complete a
  `stack build` command before you can run `stack repl`.
- Make your haddock markup documentation for *users* of the functions. Put notes
  about implementation details in separate comments that don't get pulled into
  the haddocks
- Disambiguate variables by using a trailing `_`, never export these
