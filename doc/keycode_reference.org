* An overview of the representation, naming, and aliases for keycodes across platforms


** Keycode representation

*** Linux
Linux keycodes are represented by an unsigned 16-bit integer, at least in 64 bit
Linux. I've only ever considered 64bit Linux, and I've gotten no complaints.
Assuming this works.

*** Windows
Windows keycodes are represented by an unsigned 32-bit integer, I think this is
true for all Windowses, another one of these situations that I haven't really
tested very deeply, but haven't heard any complaints yet.

** Table of keys

Let's try to make this table complete, so that for any keycode in any OS occurs
in this table, this keycode occurs in this table. If a keycode is not defined
for an OS, mark the cell with a ~.
